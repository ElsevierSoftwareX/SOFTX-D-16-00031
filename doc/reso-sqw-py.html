	<h1>Python S(q,w) Models</h1>	

	<p>A S(q,w) Python module has to define the two functions "TakinInit" and "TakinSqw".</p>
	
	<p>"TakinInit" is called after one or several parameters have changed
	(for example after each minimisation step in the convolution fitter). 
	It can be used to check if e.g. pre-calculated tables, variables, etc. need 
	to be recalculated.</p>

	<p>The "TakinSqw" function receives four floating-point parameters h,k,l, and E
	and returns a single floating-point value S, the dynamical structure factor.
	The function is called for every Monte-Carlo point.</p>

	<p>All global variables that are defined in an S(q,w) Python module are made
	available as fit parameters for the convolution fitter.</p>


	<p>The interface is defined as follows (a full example can be found in the 
	subdirectory "examples/sqw_py"):

	<code><pre>
	def TakinInit():
	    # reinitialise variables here
	    pass

	def TakinSqw(h, k, l, E):
	    S = 0.
	    # calculate S here
	    return S
	</pre></code> </p>
