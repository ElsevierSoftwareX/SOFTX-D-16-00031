Preparations before compilation
-------------------------------


Install (developer versions of) all required libraries either from your
system's package manager or directly from the given URLs:
	* Boost: http://www.boost.org
	* Qt 4: http://www.qt.io
	* Qwt 6: http://qwt.sourceforge.net
	* Clipper: http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~cowtan/clipper/

Set up other external dependencies:
	* ./setup_externals.sh

		! Please note the on-screen messages as some files need to be downloaded manually !
		These files are needed for generating tables of physical constants with
		the program "gentab" which is automatically called during the make process,
		but can also be called manually.

Building Takin
--------------


Takin has to be compiled with a fully C++11 compliant compiler, e.g.:
	* GCC version 4.8 or above
	* Clang

Make using CMake:
	* mkdir build
	* cd build
	* cmake ..
	* make
	* optional: make install (as root)


Run program with
	* takin (main GUI)
	* convofit (convolution fitter)
